        <p>Hey Nisha,</p>
        <p>
            Hope you doing well! I Wanted To Do something for you on Valentines Day but you said you were busy D:
            So Instead I used my knowledge of CS to make you this mini thing. I know it not much but something is something.
            I know you know this already but you are quite an amazing person. Your energy and personality is one that cant be replace.
            (yes i know cheesy/cringe as ever hahah). For these couple of week of texting you it been honeslty a great time... even tho you bully
            me 24/7 (IT NOT A SKILL ISSUE LOL). I would like to hangout with you again someday when both our schedule from work and School
            are free. If I made this right there should be two thing on the Right side of the page; Gift 1 and Gift 2 these are my Valentines Gift
            from me to you. Anyways agian Happy Valentines Day and hope to talk to you very soon! :D
        </p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>Melvin Galicia Diaz</p>
